INTRODUCTION

	BMI is the Bug Module Interface. This is a hardware standard for low
	power plug and play devices. It's a bit like USB, but with lower power
	requirements for mobile/embedded/battery-powered Devices. 


DESIGN OVERVIEW
	
	BMI is composed of slots and PIMs (Plug In Modules). Slots are the
	abstraction for the physical slots on a machine (bug board for this
	version) PIM's Slot drivers are platform specific, and some devices
	are slot limited such that a high baud video device may have only a
	few select slots that it will work in. 

	PIM's are intended to work on any platform supporting the BMI, 
	regardless of the underlying platform, as long as the slot provides
	the required features of the PIM.
	
	As a bare minimum a BMI slot needs to provide and I2C connection, as
	well as 2 IRQ pins to register the insertion and removal of modules.

BMI BOOT PROCESS
	The core BMI module is loaded as a bus driver as compiled-in kernel 
	module (see drivers/bmi/core/ ) During boot BMI is loaded and runs, 
	and slots are regiestered as bus items.  Then modules are detected and
	loaded individually depending on what module info was detected. 
	
	Modules can alternately be loaded at run-time when they are detected by
	a change on a slots IRQ.
